## My process

### Workflow

- Create the skeleton of the Html page like Main, H1, and other Html Tags
- Use Chrome Developer tools to design mobile-first
- Add CSS styles based on the styled-guide.md file
- Check styles with Perfect Pixel Chrome Extension
- Create styles for Desktop viewport and test it
- Refine styles 


### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Relative values
- Grammarly app for git commits and comments correctness


### What I learned

1. How to use Css custom properties (variables)

```CSS
:root {
  --paragraph-color: #7b879d;
}

.paragraph {
    color: var(--paragraph-color);
}
```
2. I learned how to work with [Perfect Pixel Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en)

3. A little bit about vw, vh, vmin, vmax and also CSS layout like Flexbox

4. [Some Markdown code](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

5. It seems irrelevant, but I used the Grammarly app for the first time to improve my Git commits and comments on this challenge. And I think for other tasks that I have I use it too Because I learned that Git commits and commands must show their meaning correctly.

### Continued development

I need more work on [CSS layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) and [CSS values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

### Useful resources

- [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - Great for reusing specific values throughout a document

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - To lay out an Html file

- [Box-sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp) - It specifies whether the padding and border properties of a tag reflect the size of the tag or not.
